This is a simple and scalable Playwright test automation framework built with **TypeScript**.

---
## Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```
### 2. Install browsers
```
npx playwright install
```

### 3. Run tests
```
npm test
```
By default:

Tests run in parallel

Console logs are captured and shown in the HTML report

An HTML report opens automatically after tests are finished

### 4. Viewing the Report
After test execution, the HTML report will open automatically. If you need to open it manually later:

```
npx playwright show-report
```
